### 1. **엔비디아 사상 최고치 경신 속 다우·S&P 500·나스닥 랠리 주춤**

US stocks wavered on Wednesday as President Trump said the Israel-Iran conflict was effectively "over" for now, while Fed Chair Jerome Powell stressed the central bank is still studying the effects of Trump's tariffs before deciding on rate cuts.

The Nasdaq Composite climbed about 0.3%, boosted by Nvidia’s 4% rise that helped the chipmaker secure a record closing price. The S&P 500 flirted with its own all-time highs but ended the trading day nearly flat, just below its record level. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones slipped about 0.3%, falling just over 100 points.

Stocks lost steam as Powell testified before the Senate Banking Committee in his second day of congressional testimony. He tangled with Republican senators amid pressure from the GOP side, most prominently from Trump himself, to cut rates.

### 2. **미국 증시·SEC, 상장사 규제 완화 논의**

U.S. exchange operators are in talks with the Securities and Exchanges Commission on easing regulatory burdens for public companies, as they seek to encourage more richly valued startups to list, according to four people familiar with the matter.
These deliberations, the details of which are reported here for the first time, involve the SEC, Nasdaq and the New York Stock Exchange. The reforms under discussion range from reducing the quantum of disclosures and the costs of going public to making it harder for minority investors to agitate, the sources said, requesting anonymity as they were not authorized to speak publicly.
The talks, which the sources said have been ongoing for several months, come amid a renewed push to ease regulations under President Donald Trump, whose administration has said it wants to do so to spur economic growth.
Taken together, some market experts said these discussions could mark the most significant push to introduce regulatory reform for companies since the Jumpstart Our Business Startups Act was signed into law by former President Barack Obama in 2012, and build on efforts seen during Trump's first term.

U.S. trade policies will likely slow down global economic growth and rekindle inflation in the United States, where there is a 40% probability of a recession in the second half of this year, JPMorgan analysts said on Wednesday.
U.S. economic growth is expected at 1.3% this year, down from a 2% forecast at the beginning of 2025, with higher U.S. tariffs seen as adding negative shocks to the economy, the bank said in a mi-year outlook research note.
"The stagflationary impulse from higher tariffs has been the impetus for our lowered GDP growth outlook for this year," it said. "We still view recession risks as elevated."
Stagflation is a worrying mix of sluggish growth and relentless inflation that haunted the U.S. in the 1970s.
The U.S. bank has a bearish outlook on the U.S. dollar due to slower U.S. growth when compared to growth-supportive policies outside of the United States that will bolster other currencies, including in emerging markets.

### 4. **제목제목**

A meteoric rally in shares of Palantir Technologies is likely to leave its imprint on the final reconstitution by FTSE Russell of its benchmark indexes on Friday, when investors can expect a crush of trading volume heading into the closing bell.
Every year, FTSE Russell reconstitutes, or refreshes, the components in its range of indexes, such as the Russell 2000 index of small-cap stocks and Russell 1000 index of large-cap names.
Together they make up the Russell 3000 index. There are also style indexes such as the Russell 1000 growth and Russell 2000 value.
Friday will be the last time the indexes are reconstituted by FTSE Russell once per year - other than when initial public offerings were added on a quarterly basis. The reshuffle forces fund managers to adjust their portfolios to reflect the new weightings and components.
"We do pay attention to it because we own a lot of companies that are on that borderline between being in or out of the Russell 2000," said Eric Kuby, chief investment officer at North Star Investment Management in Chicago.

### 5. **제목제목**

Nvidia shares rose more than 4% Wednesday to notch a new record high of $154.31, completing a remarkable turnaround from earlier this year.

Nvidia shares previously hit a record close of $149.43 on Jan. 6. The stock's gain also saw shares reach a fresh intraday high during Wednesday's trading session.

The AI chipmaker’s stock has seen a significant upswing following its first quarter earnings in late May, which featured revenue that beat Wall Street’s expectations and showed the company continuing to thrive despite a new export ban on sales of its chips to one of its largest markets: China.

Shares have jumped more than 14% since Nvidia’s May 28 earnings report, far ahead of the S&P 500’s (^GSPC) roughly 3.4% gain in that time frame. [[원문]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/nvidia-stock-notches-fresh-record-high-in-remarkable-2025-turnaround-200401502.html)

### 6. **제목제목**

A federal judge in San Francisco ruled on Wednesday for Meta Platforms against a group of authors who had argued that its use of their books without permission to train its artificial intelligence system infringed their copyrights.
U.S. District Judge Vince Chhabria said in his decision the authors had not presented enough evidence that Meta's AI would dilute the market for their work to show that the company's conduct was illegal under U.S. copyright law.
Chhabria also said, however, that using copyrighted work without permission to train AI would be unlawful in "many circumstances," splitting with another San Francisco judge who found on Monday in a separate lawsuit that Anthropic's AI training made "fair use" of copyrighted materials.
"This ruling does not stand for the proposition that Meta’s use of copyrighted materials to train its language models is lawful," Chhabria said. "It stands only for the proposition that these plaintiffs made the wrong arguments and failed to develop a record in support of the right one."
Spokespeople for Meta and attorneys for the authors did not immediately respond to requests for comment. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/sustainability/boards-policy-regulation/meta-fends-off-authors-us-copyright-lawsuit-over-ai-2025-06-25/)

### 7. **제목제목**

A first public test of robotaxis by Tesla in Austin, Texas led to multiple traffic problems and driving issues, videos from company-selected riders showed over the first few days.
Chief Executive Elon Musk has tied Tesla's financial future to self-driving technology, and with Tesla sales down, the stakes are high. He said Tesla would roll out the service to other U.S. cities later this year and predicted "millions of Teslas" operating "fully autonomously" by the second half of next year.
The Tesla fans invited to the trial were strongly supportive and posted videos of hours of trouble-free driving, but issues drew questions from federal road safety regulators and auto safety experts.
Issues included Tesla robotaxis entering the wrong lane, dropping passengers off in the middle of multiple-lane roads or at intersections, sudden braking, speeding and driving over a curb.

Micron Technology forecast fourth-quarter revenue above Wall Street estimates on Wednesday on robust demand for its high-bandwidth memory (HBM) chips used in artificial intelligence data centers.

The memory chip maker reported a nearly 50% jump in third-quarter sales of its HBM chips from the previous three months, and said it will continue to invest in the chips.

The results and the investment plans underscore a rise in demand for AI chips such as those from Nvidia and Advanced Micro Devices, both of which use Micron's memory chips.

Micron also expects its market share in HBM chips would grow to match its overall share for dynamic random access memory (DRAM) chips sometime in the second half of calendar 2025.

The company is one of the providers of high-bandwidth memory chips, besides South Korea's SK Hynix and Samsung.

Micron said it expects fourth-quarter revenue of $10.7 billion, plus or minus $300 million, compared with analysts' average estimate of $9.88 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.

For the third quarter, Micron reported revenue of $9.30 billion, compared with estimates of $8.87 billion. [[원문]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/micron-forecasts-quarterly-revenue-above-200732158.html)
