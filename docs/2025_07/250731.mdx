### 1. **제목제목**

### 2. **Fed's preferred inflation gauge shows price increases accelerated in June amid tariff uncertainty**

The latest reading of the Federal Reserve's preferred inflation gauge showed price increases accelerated in June as inflation remained above the Fed's 2% target.

The "core" Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index, which strips out food and energy costs and is closely watched by the central bank, rose 0.3% from the prior month, in line with the 0.3% economists had expected and above the 0.2% increase seen in May.

On an annual basis, core prices rose 2.8%, above the 2.7% economists had expected and in line with May's reading. May's 2.8% reading was revised higher from an initially reported 2.7% increase.

"The above-target rise in core PCE prices in June, upward revisions to previous months’ data and the sharp rise in core goods inflation will do little to ease the Fed’s concerns about tariff-driven inflation," Capital Economics assistant economist Harry Chambers wrote in a note to clients on Thursday.

### 3. **Trump says US will set 15% tariff on South Korean imports under new deal**

President Donald Trump said on Wednesday the U.S. will charge a 15% tariff on imports from South Korea, down from a threatened 25%, as part of a deal that eases tensions with a top-10 trading partner and key Asian ally.
South Korea also agreed to invest $350 billion in the United States in projects selected by Trump and to purchase energy products worth $100 billion.
The arrangement, announced after Trump met with Korean officials at the White House, came during a blizzard of trade policy announcements. Many countries are rushing to cut deals ahead of August 1, when Trump has promised higher tariffs will kick in.
"I am pleased to announce that the United States of America has agreed to a Full and Complete Trade Deal with the Republic of Korea," Trump wrote on Truth Social.
The negotiations were an early test for South Korean President Lee Jae Myung, who took office in June after a snap election. He said the deal eliminated uncertainty and set U.S. tariffs lower than or at the same level as major competitors.
"We have crossed a big hurdle," Lee said in a Facebook post. Trump said Lee would visit the White House "within the next two weeks" for his first meeting with the U.S. president.

### 4. **China flags concerns over potential security risks in Nvidia's H20 chips**

China raised concerns over potential security risks in Nvidia's H20 artificial intelligence chip, casting uncertainty over the U.S. company's sales prospects in China weeks after a U.S. export ban was reversed.
The Cyberspace Administration of China, the country's internet regulator, said it was concerned by a U.S. proposal for advanced chips sold abroad to be equipped with tracking and positioning functions.
It said it had summoned Nvidia to a meeting on Thursday to explain whether its H20 AI chip had any backdoor security risks, as it was worried that Chinese user data and privacy rights could be affected.
Nvidia did not immediately respond to a Reuters' request for comment.
In May, U.S. senator Tom Cotton introduced a bill that would direct the Commerce Department to require location verification mechanisms for AI chips subject to export restrictions, to curb Chinese access to advanced U.S. semiconductor technology.
Nvidia has been in the crosshairs of U.S.-China relations and China's move comes shortly after the U.S. this month reversed an April ban on Nvidia selling the H20 chip to China. The company developed the H20 chip for the Chinese market after the U.S. imposed export restrictions on advanced AI chips in late 2023.
