### 1. **다우 급등·나스닥 하락... 트럼프 세제안 상원 통과**

US stocks were mixed on Tuesday as President Trump's massive budget bill passed in the Senate and Wall Street watched for progress on trade talks.

The S&P 500 closed down 0.1%, pulling back from a record close after finishing above 6,200 for the first time on Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite fell around 0.7%, with Tesla stock sliding 5% as CEO Elon Musk's feud with Trump flared up again.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose about 1%, largely led by a pop in healthcare stocks including United Healthcare, which rose 4.5%.

Senate lawmakers voted 50-50, with Vice President JD Vance breaking the tie, to pass Trump's signature tax and spending bill, racing to meet the president's desired July 4 deadline. The bill now goes back to the House, which will vote on the Senate's changes.

### 2. **파월, 7월 금리 인하 가능성 열어두자 기대감 상승**

Financial market bets rose that the Federal Reserve could start interest-rate cuts as soon as this month after Fed Chair Jerome Powell, asked if July was too soon to consider rate cuts, said he "can't say" but that the decision would depend on the economic data.
Short-term interest-rate futures pointed to about a one-in-four chance of a rate cut by the Fed's July 29-30 meeting after the comments at a central banking conference in Sintra, Portugal, up from less than one-in-five from earlier. A rate cut by September is seen as virtually certain, with two more rate cuts expected by yearend, based on market pricing.

### 3. **미 상원, 트럼프 대규모 증세·지출 법안 가결... 하원 격돌 예고**

U.S. Senate Republicans passed President Donald Trump's massive tax-and-spending bill on Tuesday by the narrowest of margins, advancing a package that would slash taxes, reduce social safety net programs and boost military and immigration enforcement spending while adding $3.3 trillion to the national debt.
The legislation now heads to the House of Representatives for possible final approval, though a handful of Republicans there have already voiced opposition to some of the Senate provisions. Trump wants to sign it into law by the July 4 Independence Day holiday, and House Speaker Mike Johnson said in a statement that he aimed to meet that deadline.
The measure would extend Trump's 2017 tax cuts, give new tax breaks for income from tips and overtime pay and increase spending on the military and immigration enforcement. It also would cut about $930 billion of spending on the Medicaid health program and food aid for low-income Americans and repeal many of Democratic former President Joe Biden's green-energy incentives.

### 4. **트럼프, 머스크와 갈등 격화... 테슬라·스페이스X 지원 위협**

U.S. President Donald Trump on Tuesday threatened to cut off the billions of dollars in subsidies that Elon Musk's companies receive from the federal government, in an escalation of the war of words between the president and the world's richest man, one-time allies who have since fallen out.
The feud reignited on Monday when Musk, who spent hundreds of millions on Trump's re-election, renewed his criticism of Trump's tax-cut and spending bill, which would eliminate subsidies for electric vehicle purchases that have benefited Tesla, the leading U.S. EV maker. That bill passed the Senate by a narrow margin midday Tuesday.
"He's upset that he's losing his EV mandate and … he's very upset about things but he can lose a lot more than that," Trump told reporters at the White House on Tuesday.
Though Musk has often said government subsidies should be eliminated, Tesla has historically benefited from billions of dollars in tax credits and other policy benefits because of its business in clean transportation and renewable energy. The Trump administration has control over many of those programs, some of which are targeted in the tax bill, including a $7,500 consumer tax credit that has made buying or leasing EVs more attractive for consumers.

### 5. **나스닥, 대형 IPO 힘입어 상반기 신규 상장서 NYSE 앞서**

Nasdaq handily beat the New York Stock Exchange in stock market listings during the first half of 2025, buoyed by blockbuster initial public offerings of big names like CoreWeave and Chime and a jump in proceeds raised via special purpose acquisition companies.
IPOs at Nasdaq, including those of blank-check acquisition companies, raised about $21.3 billion during the first half, compared with $8.7 billion for flotations at the NYSE, according to data from Dealogic.
Excluding SPAC volumes, traditional IPOs on the Nasdaq raised roughly $9 billion from 79 deals, while 15 IPOs on NYSE raised about $7.8 billion. Last year during the same period, Nasdaq IPOs had raised about $6.1 billion, while shares worth $11.5 billion were sold from IPOs on NYSE.
Stock market launches dropped off sharply during the April market selloff that was driven by erratic U.S. trade policy, but Wall Street has since recovered and companies are starting to rush back to seek listings.

### 6. **노보노디스크, 미국 감량 시장 오판 사례**

Novo Nordisk's top executives ignored internal warnings that the company was not sufficiently prepared for the launch of its weight-loss drug Wegovy, leaving the Danish drugmaker in a more vulnerable position when rival Eli Lilly entered the market, six former employees involved in the discussions told Reuters.
Novo has enjoyed a tremendous windfall of $46 billion (292 billion Danish crowns) in net profit since mid-2021, when Wegovy became the first highly effective obesity treatment approved in the United States. But Lilly's Zepbound therapy outstripped Wegovy in weekly new prescriptions this year and the company struggles to convince investors it can remain competitive in the weight-loss boom.
In response, Novo is reorganizing its leadership team following the surprise ouster of Chief Executive Lars Fruergaard Jorgensen. Other key executives had already stepped down, including U.S. chief Doug Langa, who, according to two former employees, had insisted on a commercial launch very soon after Wegovy's U.S. approval.

### 7. **아스트라제네카, 미국 증시 이전 검토 중... 더타임스 보도**

AstraZeneca is considering moving its stock market listing from London, where it is the exchange's most valuable company, to the United States, the Times reported on Tuesday, citing multiple sources.
Any such move would be a major blow to the UK stock market, which has seen a string of delistings and missed out on some major initial public offerings in recent months.
It would also appeal to President Donald Trump's hopes of drawing investment to the United States, even as his trade policy has created uncertainty for global companies. He has threatened to impose 25% tariffs on pharmaceutical imports.
CEO Pascal Soriot has privately expressed a preference to shift AstraZeneca's listing on multiple occasions and has also discussed relocating the company's domicile, the Times said.
AstraZeneca, which has a market value of about 156 billion pounds ($213 billion), declined to comment. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/astrazeneca-ceo-eyes-us-market-listing-times-reports-2025-07-01/)

### 8. **미국 대형은행들, 스트레스 테스트 통과 후 배당·자사주 매입 확대**

U.S. banking giants announced plans on Tuesday to raise their third-quarter dividends after clearing the Federal Reserve's annual health check last week.
The moves come after the lenders showed they have enough capital to withstand scenarios including a severe economic downturn, spiking unemployment and market turmoil.
JPMorgan Chase, the nation's largest bank, raised its dividend to $1.50 a share from $1.40, according to a regulatory filing. It also announced a new $50 billion share repurchase program, effective on Tuesday and with an unspecified end date.
"The board’s intended dividend increase, our second this year, represents a sustainable level of capital distribution to our shareholders and is supported by our strong financial performance," JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon said.
"The new share repurchase program provides the ability to distribute capital to our shareholders over time, as we see fit," Dimon said, adding that the stress test shows that banks are resilient.
Separately, Bank of America will raise its dividend by 8% to 28 cents per share, while Wells Fargo increased it to 45 cents a share from 40 cents, they said in separate filings.
