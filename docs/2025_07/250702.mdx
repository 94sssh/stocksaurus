![s&p500_250702](/map/250702.png)

### 1. **S&P 500·나스닥, 베트남 무역협정 훈풍에 또다시 사상 최고치... 주요 고용지표 앞두고 기대**

US stocks moved higher to clinch more record highs on Wednesday as optimism over US trade deals rose at the same time that more signs of an intensifying labor market slowdown bolstered the case for the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average (^DJI) was just below the flat line. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) rose nearly 0.5%, closing at an all-time high of 6,277.42.

The Nasdaq Composite (^IXIC) moved up more than 0.9%, also hitting a record close at 20,393.13. Apple (AAPL) stock rose after an upgrade from Jefferies (JEF) analysts, and Tesla (TSLA) shares climbed after the EV maker produced more vehicles globally than expected in the second quarter even as sales plummeted.

### 2. **하원 공화당, 오늘 밤 트럼프 감세안 표결 예상**

Republicans in the House of Representatives on Wednesday struggled to pass President Donald Trump's massive tax-cut and spending bill as a handful of hardliners withheld their support over concerns about its cost.
As lawmakers shuttled in and out of closed-door meetings, House Speaker Mike Johnson said he was trying to convince the holdouts to back Trump's signature bill, telling reporters, "We're planning on a vote today."
With a narrow 220-212 majority, Johnson can afford no more than three defections from his ranks, and skeptics from the party's right flank said they had more than enough votes to block the bill.
“He knows I'm a ‘no.’ He knows that I don't believe there are the votes to pass this rule the way it is,” Republican Representative Andy Harris of Maryland, leader of the hardline Freedom Caucus, told reporters.

### 3. **6월 고용보고서, 채용 둔화·실업률 상승 전망**

The June jobs report is expected to show hiring slowed while the unemployment rate moved higher. The data's release will come as investors closely watch for any further signs of slowing in the US labor market amid growing debate over when the Federal Reserve will cut interest rates next.

The Bureau of Labor Statistics data is slated for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Thursday. Economists expect nonfarm payrolls to have risen by 110,000 in June and the unemployment rate to have moved up to 4.3%, according to consensus estimates compiled by Bloomberg.

In May, the US economy added 139,000 jobs. Meanwhile, the unemployment rate held flat at 4.2%.

The release comes as signs of cooling in the job market have continued to emerge in recent data. On Wednesday, ADP data showed private employers unexpectedly cut 33,000 jobs in June. This marked the first month of job losses in the private sector since March 2023. Meanwhile, continuing filings for unemployment benefits recently hit their highest level in nearly four years.

### 4. **마이크로소프트, 대규모 AI 투자 속 직원 약 4% 감원**

Microsoft will lay off nearly 4% of its workforce, the company said on Wednesday, in the latest job cuts as the tech giant looks to rein in costs amid hefty investments in artificial intelligence infrastructure.
The company, which had about 228,000 employees worldwide as of June 2024, had announced layoffs in May, affecting around 6,000 workers. It was planning to cut thousands of jobs, particularly in sales, Bloomberg News reported last month.
The Windows maker had pledged $80 billion in capital spending for its fiscal year 2025. However, the soaring cost of scaling its AI infrastructure has weighed on its margins, with its June quarter cloud margin expected to shrink from last year.
Microsoft said on Wednesday it planned to reduce organizational layers with fewer managers and streamline its products, procedures and roles.
The Seattle Times first reported on the layoffs earlier on Wednesday. Separately, Bloomberg News reported Microsoft's Barcelona-based King division, which makes the Candy Crush video game, is cutting 10% of its staff, or about 200 jobs.

### 5. **테슬라, 인도량 감소로 2년 연속 판매 하락 위기**

Tesla is headed for another year of shrinking sales after it posted a second straight drop in quarterly deliveries, dragged down by CEO Elon Musk's right-wing political stances and an aging vehicle line-up that has turned off some buyers.
The automaker now needs to deliver over one million vehicles in the typically strong second half to avoid another annual sales decline — a task that some analysts say could prove difficult due to tariff-driven economic uncertainty and threats to phase out key EV incentives under the Trump administration's sweeping tax bill, including the $7,500 credit on new sales and leases.
It reported on Wednesday that deliveries fell 13.5% in the second quarter, missing analysts' expectations even after Musk said in April that sales had turned a corner.
Still, shares, down about a quarter this year, rose 4.5% as the drop was less severe than the bleakest analysts views, partly helped by a modest demand recovery in the competitive Chinese market, where its refreshed Model Y has gained some traction.

### 6. **구글, EU 반독점 과징금 막기 위해 새 제안 제출**

Google has proposed fresh changes to its search results in an attempt to fend off growing criticism from rivals, a week before a key meeting that could lead to yet another EU antitrust fine, according to a document seen by Reuters.
The U.S. tech giant has been under pressure after being hit in March with European Union antitrust charges of unfairly favouring its own services such as Google Shopping, Google Hotels and Google Flights over competitors.
The company, owned by Alphabet, will meet its rivals and the European Commission to discuss its proposals during a July 7-8 workshop in Brussels, the document said.
The EU's landmark Digital Markets Act, under which Google has been charged, sets out a list of dos and don'ts for Big Tech aimed at curbing their power and giving rivals more room to compete and consumers more choice.
Last week, Google offered to create a box at the top of the search page for a so-called vertical search service (VSS) which would contain links to specialised search engines as well as to hotels, airlines, restaurants and transport services.

### 7. **오라클·오픈AI, 미국 데이터센터 확대 위해 스타게이트 협력 강화**

OpenAI has agreed to rent a massive amount of computing power from Oracle Corp. data centers as part of its Stargate initiative, underscoring the intense requirements for cutting-edge artificial intelligence products.
The AI company will rent additional capacity from Oracle totaling about 4.5 gigawatts of data center power in the US, according to people familiar with the work who asked not to be named discussing private information.

That is an unprecedented sum of energy that could power millions of American homes. A gigawatt is akin to the capacity from one nuclear reactor and can provide electricity to roughly 750,000 houses.

Earlier this week, Oracle announced that it had signed a single cloud deal worth $30 billion in annual revenue beginning in fiscal 2028 without naming the customer. This Stargate agreement makes up at least part of that disclosed contract, according to one of the people. [[원문]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/oracle-openai-expand-stargate-deal-190740406.html)
