### 1. **제목제목**

US stocks closed mixed on Monday, but the Nasdaq Composite and S&P 500 managed to notch fresh records. Wall Street began a busy week of Big Tech-highlighted earnings and eyed the continued risks around President Trump's tariffs.

The tech-heavy Nasdaq gained about 0.4%, notching its sixth-consecutive record close following last week’s record-setting rally in growth names. The S&P 500 rose just over 0.1% to close above 6,300 for the first time ever. Meanwhile, the Dow Jones Industrial Average flipped from gains to close just below the flatline.

This week sees investor focus dominated by two topics: Clarity on US trade policy as the implementation of sweeping new tariffs looms on Aug. 1, and earnings from tech heavyweights.

### 2. **제목제목**

Morgan Stanley backed its bullish stance on U.S. equities on Monday, citing strong earnings momentum, and said it was expecting a modest pullback in the third quarter that could create an opportunity to buy the dip.
The Wall Street brokerage is leaning more towards its bull case of the benchmark S&P 500 hitting 7,200 points by the middle of the year, it wrote in a note. In May, the brokerage said the S&P 500 was expected to hit 6,500 in the second quarter of 2026.
"With earnings on solid footing into next year and the Fed closer to cutting rates, valuations can remain supported around current levels (~22x) as we think about the 12-month outlook," Morgan Stanley equity strategists led by Michael Wilson said.

A sweeping cyber espionage operation targeting Microsoft server software compromised about 100 organizations as of the weekend, two of the organizations that helped uncover the campaign said on Monday.
Microsoft on Saturday issued an alert about "active attacks" on self-hosted SharePoint servers, which are widely used by organizations to share documents and collaborate within organizations. SharePoint instances run off of Microsoft servers were unaffected.
Dubbed a "zero-day" because it leverages a previously undisclosed digital weakness, the hacks allow spies to penetrate vulnerable servers and potentially drop a backdoor to secure continuous access to victim organizations.

### 4. **제목제목**

AstraZeneca plans to spend $50 billion to expand manufacturing and research capabilities in the U.S. by 2030, it said on Monday, the latest big investment by a pharmaceutical company reacting to President Donald Trump's tariff policy.
The investment will fund a new drug manufacturing facility in Virginia and expand research and development (R&D) and cell therapy manufacturing in Maryland, Massachusetts, California, Indiana and Texas, it said in a statement.
It will also upgrade the Anglo-Swedish drugmaker's U.S. clinical trial supply network and support ongoing investment in novel medicines.
On Monday, AstraZeneca said the expansion supports its ambition to reach $80 billion in annual revenue by 2030, with half coming from the U.S.
The U.S. accounted for more than 40% of AstraZeneca's annual revenue in 2024, and the company had been prioritising the market - the world's largest, worth $635 billion - before Trump's return to office.

### 5. **제목제목**

Trump Media stock closed up 3% Monday after rising more than 5% intraday on news that the company had purchased $2 billion in bitcoin and related securities.

President Trump's namesake media group runs his social media platform, Truth Social, along with streaming platform Truth+ and financial services brand Truth.Fi. Trump Media said it acquired the cryptocurrencies as part of a previously shared plan in May to become a bitcoin treasury company.

With those purchases, Trump Media said exposure to the world's largest cryptocurrency now comprises two-thirds of its total of $3 billion in assets. [[원문]](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/trump-media-stock-surges-after-acquiring-2-billion-of-bitcoin-133712159.html)

Figma is targeting a fully-diluted valuation of up to $16.4 billion in its initial public offering, as the cloud-based design software firm prepares for a debut on the NYSE that could inject fresh momentum into a resurgent market for tech listings.
The San Francisco-based company, along with some investors, is eyeing proceeds of up to $1.03 billion by selling nearly 37 million shares priced between $25 and $28 each, it said on Monday.
The listing could be a major milestone for Figma, coming more than a year after its $20 billion sale to Adobe failed due to regulatory hurdles in Europe and the UK.
An equities rally and a bunch of strong debuts recently have helped remove the IPO market overhang. Figma is expected to start trading close on the heels of stablecoin giant Circle, which debuted with eye-popping gains last month and has continued surging since.

### 7. **제목제목**

Kraft Heinz's potential spinoff of slower-growing brands such as Velveeta cheese is a risky last-ditch effort to boost returns by reversing its unsuccessful decade-old merger.
The Chicago- and Pittsburgh-based foodmaker is studying a potential spinoff of a large chunk of its grocery business, including many Kraft products, into a new entity, a source said on July 11, confirming a report in the Wall Street Journal. That entity could be valued at up to $20 billion on its own, which would make it the biggest deal in consumer goods so far this year.
The company declined to comment on the move.
Shares in the food maker have lost about two-thirds of their value since Kraft and H.J. Heinz merged in 2015 in a deal backed by Warren Buffet's Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N), opens new tab that was aimed at cutting costs and growing the brands internationally.
