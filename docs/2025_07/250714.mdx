### 1. **다우·S&P 500·나스닥 선물 혼조세... 인플레이션 지표·대형 은행 실적 발표 앞둬**

US stock futures wavered Monday evening as Wall Street girded for a key consumer inflation print and for big banks to kick off earnings season, with tariff-driven concerns in focus for both events.

Futures tied to the S&P 500 were down 0.1%. Those on the tech-heavy Nasdaq were relatively flat after the Nasdaq Composite closed Monday at its latest record high. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures also slipped 0.1%.

Investors are bracing for June's release of the Consumer Price Index, due for release at 8:30 a.m. ET on Tuesday. The report is expected to show the first real signs of a tariff-driven uptick on prices. Headline CPI is forecast to rise 0.3% month over month and 2.4% year over year. Both would represent accelerations from May's data.

### 2. **EU, 미국 관세에 보복 경고... 트럼프는 협상 가능성 열어둬**

The European Union on Monday accused the U.S. of resisting efforts to strike a trade deal and warned of countermeasures if no agreement is reached to avoid the punishing tariffs President Donald Trump has threatened to impose starting on August 1.
Trump, meanwhile, said he was open to further discussions with the EU and other trading partners before new 30% tariffs kick in next month and that EU officials would be coming to the United States for negotiations.
"They would like to do a different kind of a deal and we're always open to talk, including to Europe," he told reporters in the Oval Office. "In fact, they're coming over. They'd like to talk."
Trump stepped up his trade war on Saturday, saying he would impose a 30% tariff on most imports from the EU and Mexico next month, following similar warnings for other countries including Asian economic powerhouses Japan and South Korea.

### 3. **6월 인플레이션, 트럼프의 관세 위협 속 상승 반전 전망**

June's Consumer Price Index (CPI) is expected to show prices rose at a faster clip compared to May. The report, due Tuesday at 8:30 a.m. ET, comes as investors closely monitor whether President Trump's tariffs are starting to filter through to what consumers pay, even as inflation data has so far remained more resilient than expected.

According to Bloomberg data, headline CPI is expected to have increased 2.6% year over year in June, up from a 2.4% rise in May. On a monthly basis, prices are forecast to climb 0.3%, marking an acceleration from the 0.1% gain the prior month.

On a "core" basis, which strips out volatile food and energy prices, the annual inflation rate for June is expected to come in at 2.9%, a slight pickup from May’s 2.8%. Core prices are also projected to climb 0.3% month over month, outpacing the previous 0.1% rise seen in May.

In May, falling car and apparel prices, categories seen as early indicators of tariff impacts, contributed to a cooler-than-expected core CPI reading. But economists expect those trends to reverse in June, potentially pushing core inflation higher.

### 4. **파월 의장, 트럼프 측 비판받은 프로젝트에 감찰관 검토 요청**

Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has asked the U.S. central bank's inspector general to review the costs involved in the renovation of its historic headquarters in Washington, as Trump administration officials intensify their criticism of how the Fed is being run.
The request to Fed Inspector General Michael Horowitz, first reported by Axios, was made over the weekend, according to a source familiar with the matter.
It follows a letter to Powell last week from Office of Management and Budget Director Russell Vought, who wrote that President Donald Trump was "extremely troubled" by cost overruns in the $2.5 billion project. In material posted to its website on Friday, the Fed described the challenges in a complete rehabilitation of the nearly 100-year-old Marriner S. Eccles building and a neighboring property on Constitution Avenue in the nation's capital.
OMB has no oversight over the Fed, which funds its own operations separately from the appropriations process in Congress. The Federal Reserve Act also gives the central bank's seven-member Board of Governors control over its building and related projects, with oversight by Congress and the Fed's independent IG, which has been reviewing the renovations throughout the process.

### 5. **트럼프 지출 법안, 보험사 비용 증가·메디케이드 축소 가능성**

President Donald Trump's spending bill is set to raise administrative costs and make managing costs more difficult for insurers like UnitedHealthcare and CVS Health's Aetna that operate Medicaid health plans, experts say.
As a result, those insurers will likely pull back their Medicaid coverage and invest more in existing markets to retain their healthier members, experts said.
States contract with insurers, including UnitedHealth Group's UnitedHealthcare, CVS Health's Aetna, Centene and Molina, to operate Medicaid plans that are jointly funded by state and federal governments.
Almost all of Molina's and nearly half of Centene's insurance business is composed of Medicaid members. That portion is smaller for Aetna and UnitedHealthcare which operate large commercial businesses.

### 6. **GM, 테네시 공장서 저가형 배터리셀 생산 예정**

General Motors is planning to produce lower-cost battery cells at its joint-venture plant with South Korea's LG Energy Solution in Tennessee.
The Detroit automaker is rolling out production of lithium-iron-phosphate (LFP) batteries, a technology that is gaining popularity at other automakers in the U.S. including at cross-town rival Ford Motor(F.N), opens new tab. GM will begin converting battery cell lines at its Spring Hill, Tennessee facility later this year, and commercial production is expected to begin by late 2027, the company said Monday.
GM and other automakers have pulled back some of their goals around electric vehicle production as demand for the models has been weaker-than-anticipated. Still, auto companies are investing billions in future battery technology and EV production facilities, with the expectation that shoppers will eventually make the switch from traditional gasoline vehicles.

### 7. **메타 저커버그, AI 초지능 개발 위해 수백억 달러 규모 데이터센터 투자 약속**

Mark Zuckerberg said on Monday that Meta Platforms would spend hundreds of billions of dollars to build several massive AI data centers for superintelligence, intensifying his pursuit of a technology he has chased with a talent war for top engineers.
The social media giant is among the large tech companies that have struck high-profile deals and doled out multi-million-dollar pay packages in recent months to fast-track work on machines that could outthink humans on many tasks.
Its first multi-gigawatt data center, dubbed Prometheus, is expected to come online in 2026, while another, called Hyperion, will be able to scale up to 5 gigawatts over the coming years, Zuckerberg said in a post on his Threads social media platform.
"We're building multiple more titan clusters as well. Just one of these covers a significant part of the footprint of Manhattan," the billionaire CEO said. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/zuckerberg-says-meta-will-invest-hundreds-billions-superintelligence-2025-07-14/)

### 8. **메타 개인정보 침해 의혹... 저커버그·투자자, 80억 달러 재판서 맞대결**

Mark Zuckerberg is expected to appear as a star witness in an unusual $8 billion trial that kicks off this week at which the Meta CEO is accused of operating Facebook as an illegal enterprise that allowed users' data to be harvested without their consent.
Shareholders of Meta Platforms , the parent company of Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp, sued Zuckerberg and other current and former company leaders, saying they continually violated a 2012 agreement between Facebook and the Federal Trade Commission to protect users' data.
The case dates back to 2018, after it emerged that data from millions of Facebook users was accessed by Cambridge Analytica, a now-defunct political consulting firm that worked for Donald Trump's successful campaign for U.S. president in 2016.
Shareholders want Zuckerberg and the other defendants to reimburse the company for more than $8 billion in fines and other costs paid by Meta after the Cambridge Analytica scandal came to light, including a record $5 billion fine imposed on Facebook by the FTC in 2019 for violating the 2012 agreement.

### 9. **볼보, 관세·출시 지연 여파로 10억 달러 손실 반영**

Sweden-based Volvo Cars is booking a impairment charge of 11.4 billion crowns ($1.2 billion) in the second quarter related to its ES90 and upcoming EX90 models, due to tariffs and launch delays, it said on Monday.
The group, which is controlled by China's Geely Holding, said it is currently unable to sell its Volvo ES90, which is built in China, profitably in the United States due to import tariffs, while profit margins for the same model are also under pressure in Europe for the same reason.
"The charge primarily reflects adjustments in expected volumes and planned lifecycle profitability associated with the platform for the EX90 and ES90 cars," it said in a statement.
The impairment charge also reflects significant launch delays in the past and subsequent additional development costs, it said. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/volvo-cars-books-12-bln-impairment-charge-q2-2025-07-14/)

### 10. **뱅가드, 지수펀드 붐에 힘입어 암호화폐 투자 본격 확대**

Bitcoin is not “appropriate” for long-term investors. Also, digital assets are more a speculation and less an investment. And they’re an “immature asset class” with little history and “no inherent economic value” that can wreak “havoc” on portfolios.

Vanguard Group Inc. executives, channeling the logic of the venerable Jack Bogle, have made their opinions on crypto clear. Yet thanks to the cold logic of index investing, the $10 trillion money-management giant is now the biggest backer of Strategy, the software firm that famously reinvented itself as a proxy for Bitcoin and became a poster child for the industry’s ambitions.

Vanguard owns more than 20 million shares, nearly 8%, of all of Strategy’s (MSTR) outstanding Class A common stock, and likely surpassed Capital Group Cos. for the no. 1 spot sometime in the fourth quarter, according to data compiled by Bloomberg based on regulatory filings. The dozens of Vanguard mutual funds and ETFs that hold the stakes track everything from small- and mid-cap benchmarks to momentum, value and growth gauges, among others.
