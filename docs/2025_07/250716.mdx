US stocks recovered from session lows to end Wednesday's trading session higher after President Trump said he's "not planning" to fire Fed Chair Jerome Powell, taking the air out of new reports emerging suggesting he was close to making that decision.

The S&P 500 rose about 0.3%, while the Dow Jones Industrial Average climbed 0.5%. The tech-heavy Nasdaq rose 0.3% for its latest record close.

Bloomberg reported Wednesday, citing a White House official, that Trump was considering firing Powell "soon," sending stocks lower. But Trump subsequently said in the Oval Office that he wasn't "planning" to do so, despite going on a rant at the Fed chair not lowering interest rates at his preferred pace.

Hours after President Donald Trump told a room full of Republican lawmakers that he will fire Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell, he denied plans to do that.

“We’re not planning on doing it,” he said Wednesday at the White House. “I don’t rule out anything,” he added, “but I think it’s highly unlikely, unless he has to leave for fraud.”

At a meeting Tuesday evening in the Oval Office, Trump had asked a group of House Republicans if they thought he should fire Powell. After receiving support for the move, the president said he would follow through, according to a senior White House official.

“The President asked lawmakers how they felt about firing the Fed Chair. They expressed approval for firing him. The President indicated he likely will soon,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to speak candidly on the issue.

Microsoft and a U.S. national laboratory on Wednesday said they are partnering to examine how artificial intelligence could be used to speed up the process of compiling the documents needed to secure permits for new nuclear power plants.
Microsoft and the Idaho National Laboratory (INL) said they will tap Microsoft's AI technology for generating engineering and safety analysis reports that are a standard part of the application process for construction permits and operating licenses for nuclear facilities in the United States. The AI systems, which have been trained on a huge trove of successful historical applications, will pull data from studies and compile it into complex applications that span hundreds of pages.
"It's created for human refinement, so a human can go through each of the sections and, specifically as needed, edit any of the sections, whether manually, or maybe with the help of AI - it's really up to the human," Nelli Babayan, AI director for federal civilian business at Microsoft, told Reuters in an interview.

AstraZeneca's experimental therapy anselamimab did not meet the main goal of a late-stage study for the treatment of a rare condition that causes a buildup of protein deposits in the body, the drugmaker said on Wednesday, sending shares down 1.3%.
The study was assessing a combination of how often patients with advanced, heart-related AL amyloidosis were hospitalised for cardiovascular issues, and death from any cause over a period of time, when compared with placebo.
While anselamimab did not achieve statistical significance for the overall population in the study, the therapy showed clinically meaningful improvement in a sub-group of patients, AstraZeneca said, without giving details of that group.
JPMorgan analyst James Gordon said that he expects the study "failure in all comers to be seen as a minor negative," adding that while AstraZeneca did not give details of the subgroup in which anselamimab worked, he believes the drugmaker may pursue regulatory approval there.

Ford is recalling 694,271 crossover SUVs in the United States due to a fuel leak issue that could increase the risk of a fire, the U.S. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration said on Wednesday, following a year-long investigation.
The NHTSA said fuel injector in affected vehicles may crack, causing fuel to leak into the engine compartment and potentially ignite.
Ford shares were down 3% in afternoon trading.
The recall covers certain 2021–2024 Bronco Sport and 2020–2022 Escape models equipped with 1.5-litre engines. The NHTSA estimates that 0.3% of recalled vehicles may have the defect.
"We estimate the aggregate cost of the action, based on the remedy options we are evaluating, to be about $570 million and will be reflected in our second quarter 2025 results," Ford said.

Bank of America beat estimates for second-quarter profit on Wednesday, driven by tumultuous markets that helped its traders bring in more revenue, while its interest income also rose.
Banks' trading desks benefited from market turbulence as clients reacted to shifting U.S. trade policies and escalating geopolitical tensions during the second quarter.

In trading, equities revenue surged 10%, also hitting a record for the latest quarter, while fixed income, currencies, and commodities revenue jumped 19%.
"We're also benefiting right now from repositioning - a lot of geopolitical uncertainty, a lot of rate changes, elections last year leading to new policies this year, supply chain changes," Chief Financial Officer Alastair Borthwick told reporters.

ASML, the world's biggest supplier of computer chip-making equipment, warned on Wednesday that it may not achieve revenue growth in 2026 as chipmakers building factories in the U.S. await clarity on the potential impact of tariffs.
Uncertainty in tariff talks has spurred chipmakers in the U.S. to delay finalizing investments, CFO Roger Dassen told journalists on a media call.
Shares in ASML fell as much as 10.5% and were on track for their worst day since October, dragging peers ASM, BESI, Soitec lower as well.
Investors dumped the shares even as the Dutch group's net bookings, the most closely watched figure in the industry, came in 25% above expectations at 5.54 billion euros ($6.4 billion). Analysts consensus estimate was 4.44 billion euros, according to researcher Visible Alpha.
ASML's EUV lithography machines made up 42% of those bookings, or 2.3 billion euros' worth.

Morgan Stanley's profit beat Wall Street estimates in the second quarter as its traders cashed in on volatile markets, but shares fell since the market opening as its investment banking revenue shrank.
Stock markets swung sharply during the quarter after U.S. President Donald Trump announced sweeping tariffs against major economies. This spurred volatility and trading volume, as investors repositioned their portfolios and hedged risks. But markets recovered late in the quarter and improved the outlook for business.
Morgan Stanley shares opened down 3%, but accelerated the decline to almost 4% after a report about Trump potentially taking action to fire Fed chairman Jerome Powell.
Morgan Stanley's revenue fell 5%, and fewer completed M&A transactions weighed on its advisory revenue. But executives were more optimistic about the outlook for M&A and IPOs.
"We are optimistic about the capital markets rebound," Chief Financial Officer Sharon Yeshaya told Reuters in an interview. "Companies are looking past tariffs for strategic movements and growth," she said, adding that discussions about mergers and divestitures are active again.
Overall, the bank beat forecasts with a net income of $3.5 billion, or $2.13 per share in the quarter, above the estimates compiled by LSEG of an average $1.96 per share.

United Airlines said on Wednesday travel demand has picked up since the beginning of July, thanks to less geopolitical and macroeconomic uncertainty.
The Chicago-based airline, however, expects its earnings to suffer in the current quarter due to operational constraints at Newark airport near New York City - one of its largest hubs and among the busiest in the country.
United reported a 6 percentage point acceleration in overall travel demand and a double-digit acceleration in business bookings in the third quarter from the prior quarter.
As a result, it now expects its full-year adjusted profit to come in the range of $9 a share to $11 a share. That compares with analysts' expectations of $10.04 a share.
"The world is less uncertain today than it was during the first six months of 2025 and that gives us confidence about a strong finish to the year," United CEO Scott Kirby said in a statement.
United's shares were down 1.6% in after-hours trading as its third-quarter profit estimate came in below Wall Street estimates.
The company expects an adjusted profit in the range of $2.25 a share to $2.75 per share in the quarter to end-September. The midpoint of the forecast is $2.50 per share, compared with analysts' average estimate of $2.60, according to LSEG data.
It estimates a hit of 0.9 percentage point in the third quarter, compared with a 1.2 percentage point impact in the second quarter, due to the operational issues at Newark airport. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/united-airlines-sees-profit-below-estimates-travel-spending-dips-2025-07-16/)
