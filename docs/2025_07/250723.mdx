### 1. **S&P 500, Nasdaq hit records, Dow closes in as trade hopes lift stocks before Tesla, Google**

US stocks climbed on Wednesday after the US struck a trade deal with Japan, lifting hopes for further tariff pacts as Wall Street prepared for Tesla and Alphabet earnings after the bell.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average rose more than 1.1%, or roughly 450 points, and was just four points shy of its first record close of 2025. The S&P 500 moved up almost 0.8%, and tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite nudged up around 0.6%, with both once closing at at record levels.

The US pact with Japan places a 15% tariff on imports from the country, President Trump said — a step down from the threatened 25% duties set to hit next week. For its part, Tokyo will make $550 billion in US investment. "It's a great deal for everybody," Trump said late Tuesday.

### 2. **US, EU trade talks bolstered by Trump's agreement with Japan**

The European Union and the U.S. are moving toward a trade deal that could include a 15% U.S. baseline tariff on EU goods and possible exemptions, two European diplomats said on Wednesday, potentially moving President Donald Trump closer to another major trade agreement on the heels of the one he just unveiled with Japan.
European negotiators were hoping to reach an agreement to dodge the 30% tariff rate Trump has said he would impose on imports from the 27-nation bloc on August 1.
The rate, which could also extend to cars, would mirror the framework agreement the U.S. has struck with Japan, which Trump announced late on Tuesday.
There could be concessions for sectors like aircraft and lumber as well as some medicines and agricultural products, which would not face tariffs, the diplomats said. Washington does not, however, appear willing to lower its current 50% tariff on steel, they said.

### 3. **미·일 무역협정, 글로벌 경제 최악의 상황 막아**

미국과 일본의 무역협정은 현재 워싱턴과 협상 중인 다른 여러 협정에 대한 기준점이 될 수 있으며, 세계 경제는 이번에 합의된 15% 수준을 가까스로 감내할 수 있을 것이라고 경제학자들은 밝혔습니다. 도쿄와 미국 간의 이번 협정은 자동차 수입에 대한 관세를 기존 총 27.5%에서 15%로 낮추는 내용을 담고 있습니다. 또한 8월 1일부터 일본산 기타 제품에 부과될 예정이던 관세도 25%에서 15%로 인하됩니다. 세계 4위 경제 대국과 체결한 이번 협정은 미국 도널드 트럼프 대통령이 현재까지 체결한 여러 무역협정 가운데 가장 중요한 협정으로 평가됩니다.

### 4. **크리스피 크림·고프로, 올여름 밈주 열풍 타고 동반 급등**

고프로와 크리스피 크림은 수요일 장 초반, 올여름 시장을 휩쓴 밈주식 열풍 속에서 새로운 스타로 떠오를 조짐을 보였습니다. 고프로 주가는 개장 전 거래에서 한때 90%까지 급등했다가 장 시작 후 첫 30분간 약 40% 상승폭으로 조정됐으며, 크리스피 크림은 개장 전 최대 70% 상승했다가 정규 거래 시작 시점에는 26% 상승으로 돌아섰습니다. 한때 하드웨어 및 미디어 기술 스타트업으로 주목받았던 고프로는 2014년 중반 상장 직후 주가가 98.47달러까지 올랐지만, 10년이 지난 지금 가치는 약 98% 하락해 월요일 종가는 1.37달러였습니다.

### 5. **SAP, 호실적에도 전망 유지에 주가 하락**

SAP의 주가는 수요일 하락했습니다. 독일의 소프트웨어 업체인 SAP는 분기 기준 매출과 이익이 증가했음에도 불구하고 연간 실적 전망치를 상향하지 않았기 때문입니다. 이는 일부 투자자들의 기대에 못 미친 결과였습니다. 앞서 화요일 늦게 SAP는 2분기 매출, 수익성, 자유현금흐름이 모두 증가했다고 발표했지만, “높은 수준의 불확실성과 낮아진 가시성”을 이유로 연간 전망은 유지했습니다. SAP는 2025년 전체 기준 영업이익을 103억~106억 유로로 유지하고 있으며, 이는 1년 전 81억 5,000만 유로에서 증가한 수치입니다.

### 6. **AT&T's bundled plans spur subscriber surge, tax savings to fund fiber expansion**

AT&T beat quarterly profit estimates and added more wireless subscribers than expected as customers flocked to its discounted bundles combining 5G mobile and high-speed fiber plans.
The company said on Wednesday it would invest about $3.5 billion from savings unlocked by President Donald Trump's new tax law to accelerate its fiber network build-out, a critical growth area as the wireless market saturates and internet usage surges.
The U.S. telecom giant expects to save $6.5 billion to $8 billion in taxes through 2027 under the new reforms, and projected free cash flow to be about $1 billion higher than previously forecast for both 2026 and 2027.
AT&T added 401,000 net monthly bill-paying wireless phone subscribers in the second quarter, it said on Wednesday, flying past FactSet estimates of 295,700. Verizon lost 9,000 customers during the same period.
The company reported revenue of $30.8 billion, beating estimates of $30.50 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG. Adjusted earnings per share of 54 cents also surpassed expectations of 51 cents.
Mobility revenue rose 6.7%, driven by subscriber gains and higher wireless device sales volumes. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/media-telecom/atts-fiber-subscriber-miss-takes-shine-off-strong-gains-wireless-2025-07-23/)

### 7. **NextEra beats quarterly profit estimates on massive power demand**

NextEra Energy beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter adjusted profit on Wednesday, boosted by robust growth in its renewables division amid soaring power demand from AI data centers and hyperscalers.
But NextEra stock dropped 4% to $74.14 per share on concerns about the future of renewable energy tax credits.
NEER reported net income of $983 million in the second-quarter, compared with $552 million a year ago.
The company, the largest electric utility holding company by market capitalization, reported operating revenue of $6.70 billion, missing analysts' average estimate of $7.38 billion, according to data compiled by LSEG.
NextEra also said it expects to grow its dividends at a roughly 10% rate per year through at least 2026.
The Florida-based company earned $1.05 per share on an adjusted basis, compared with analysts' average estimate of $1.01 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/nextera-beats-quarterly-profit-estimates-massive-power-demand-2025-07-23/)

### 8. **GE Vernova raises annual forecasts, beats second-quarter profit estimates**

Power equipment maker GE Vernova raised its full-year free cash flow forecast and beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit on Wednesday, sending its shares up more than 13% to an all-time high.
GE Vernova, which became independent last year after a three-way split of General Electric, raised its free cash flow (FCF) target between $3 billion and $3.5 billion from earlier forecast of $2 billion to $2.5 billion, and expects 2025 revenue to trend towards the higher end of a range of $36 billion to $37 billion.
GE Vernova posted second-quarter adjusted profit of $1.77 per share, beating analysts' estimate of $1.51, according to data compiled by LSEG, helped by strong performance in its power and electrification units.
According to the U.S. Energy Information Administration, power consumption will hit record highs in 2025 and 2026, driven by rapid expansions in AI and cryptocurrency data centers as well as increased demand from households and businesses.

### 9. **Thermo Fisher flags improving tariff situation, raises annual profit view**

Thermo Fisher on Wednesday raised the lower end of its annual profit forecast, banking on strong demand for its tools and services used in drug development and said the tariff situation was improving.
Shares of the company were up 10% in early trading.
"The US-China tariff situation has improved significantly versus our prior guidance assumptions," said Chief Financial Officer Stephen Williamson in a post earnings call.

### 10. **Boston Scientific lifts annual profit forecast, sees smaller tariff impact**

Boston Scientific raised its annual profit forecast on Wednesday, banking on strong demand for its heart devices, and trimmed its expectation for tariff-related costs to half of the previously projected amount.
A rise in surgical procedures has boosted sales for medical device makers such as Boston Scientific, helping counter broader concerns about healthcare spending.
Executives credited strong trial results and expanded product indications for fueling physician adoption of key cardiovascular devices such as Watchman and Farapulse, the firm's main growth drivers that saw steady quarterly demand.
Boston Scientific now expects 2025 adjusted profit of $2.95 to $2.99 per share, up from its prior view of $2.87 to $2.94.
It posted adjusted profit of 75 cents per share for the second quarter, topping analysts' average estimate of 72 cents, according to LSEG. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/healthcare-pharmaceuticals/boston-scientific-lifts-annual-profit-view-steady-heart-devices-demand-2025-07-23/)

### 11. **CME beats profit estimates as volatility drives record trading quarter**

Derivatives exchange CME Group beat Wall Street estimates for second-quarter profit on Wednesday, as record volatility boosted demand for its products, which are often used to hedge against macroeconomic uncertainty.
Excluding one-time items, profit attributable to CME shareholders was $1.07 billion, or $2.96 per share, for the quarter ended June 30. Analysts on average had expected a profit of $2.92 per share, according to data compiled by LSEG.
CME further benefits from greater uncertainty as it prompts market participants to switch to deeply liquid exchanges, analysts have said. It reported cash reserves of $2.2 billion, up 10% from a year ago.
CME reported record high quarterly revenue of $1.69 billion, up 10.4%. Clearing and transaction fees, which form the bulk of the company's revenue, jumped 11% to $1.39 billion. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/cme-beats-profit-estimates-volatility-drives-record-trading-quarter-2025-07-23/)

### 12. **Moody's reports higher second-quarter profit on analytics unit strength**

Ratings agency Moody's reported a rise in second quarter profit on Wednesday, driven by robust gains in its data and analytics unit and an increase in government borrowing.
Demand for market analytical tools rose in the reported quarter as investors sought health checks on Treasury debt issuance amid trade policy and interest rate uncertainties, boosting companies like Moody's.
The company's Investors Service business, which issues credit ratings, generated $1 billion in revenue, matching last year’s figure.
Profit attributable to Moody’s totalled $578 million, or $3.21 per share, in the three months ended June 30, compared with $552 million, or $3.02 per share, a year earlier.
The company narrowed its annual adjusted earnings per share forecast to a range of $13.50 to $14, a slight upgrade from its previous outlook of $13.25 to $14 per share. [[원문]](https://www.reuters.com/business/moodys-reports-higher-second-quarter-profit-analytics-unit-strength-2025-07-23/)
